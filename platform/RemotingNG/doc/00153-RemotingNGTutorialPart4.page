Remoting NG Tutorial Part 4: RESTful Web Services
Remoting NG

!!!Welcome Back

Welcome to part four of the Remoting tutorial.
This final part of the Remoting NG tutorial shows how to implement
RESTful web services or APIs with the Remoting NG REST Transport.

This tuturial assumes that you are familiar with basic POCO C++ Libraries
programming techniques. You should also have read the [[00100-RemotingNGOverview.html Remoting Overview]]
and be familiar with basic Remoting concepts, such as presented in
[[00150-RemotingNGTutorialPart1.html part 1] of the Remoting tutorial.


!!!Defining RESTful Interfaces

Defining RESTful interfaces with C++ classes for Remoting NG is different from defining interfaces
for other transports such as SOAP, JSON-RPC or TCP. The main difference is that
method names are directly mapped to HTTP request method names (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT and
DELETE). Therefore, only the following method names may be used:

  - get
  - post
  - patch
  - put
  - delete_ (note the trailing underscore)


!!RESTful vs. RPC-based interfaces

When defining RESTful interfaces, it's best to think in terms of <*collections*> and
<*resources*>, and to define <*endpoints*> for both. Typically, a collection endpoint will be
used to create new resources, and to obtain a list of existing resources of a given
type or class. For that purpose, <[post()]> and <[get()]> methods are used.
Resource endpoints are used to obtain details of a specific resource or object, make changes
to the resource, or delete it, using <[get()]>, <[patch()]> (or <[put()]>) and <[delete_()]>
methods.

The difference between RPC-based remote interfaces and RESTful interfaces is best
demonstrated using a concrete example.


!!Example: User Management

A (quite simplistic) RPC-based remote service for user account management (using the
TCP-based transport protocol, JSON-RPC or SOAP) could be implemented as follows:

    //@ serialize
    struct User
    {
        std::string name;
        Poco::Optional<std::string> password;
        Poco::Optional<std::set<std::string>> permissions;
        Poco::Optional<std::set<std::string>> roles;
    };


    //@ remote
    class UserManager
    {
    public:
        UserManager(/* ... */);
        ~UserManager();

        void addUser(const User& user);
        void updateUser(const User& user);
        User getUser(const std::string& username);
        void deleteUser(const std::string& username);

    private:
        // ...
    };
----


For implementing similar features in the form of a RESTful API, the implementation
of the interface must be done in a different way. In fact, multiple classes will be
used that cover different aspects of the web service according to REST principles.
A typical implementation could consist of the following API endpoints:

!Retrieving a List of Users

This is achieved with a GET request to the <*users*> collection:

    GET /api/1.0/users HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:80

----

The response looks like:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: nnn

    [
        {
            "name": "admin",
            "permissions:
            [
            ],
            "roles":
            [
                "administrator"
            ]
        },
        {
            ...
        }
    ]
----

Using query parameters, the result can be filtered or restricted:

    GET /api/1.0/users?maxResults=10&start=10 HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:80

----

!Creating a User

This is achieved with a POST request to the users collection:

    POST /api/1.0/users HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:80
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: nnn

    {
        "name": "admin",
        "password": "s3cr3t",
        "permissions": [
        ],
        "roles": [
            "administrator"
        ]
    }
----

!Updating and Deleting a User

We'd also like to be able to update and delete user accounts:

    PATCH /api/1.0/users/admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:80
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: nnn

    {
        "permissions": [
            "somePermission"
        ]
    }
----

    DELETE /api/1.0/users/admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:80

----

To keep things simple, we'll leave the supported operations at that. A real service could
also add endpoints for nested objects such as permissions or roles. Implementing such a
web service is straightforward with Remoting NG. We need to provide two C++ classes,
one for handling the user collection, and the other for handling a single user account.
The class declarations are shown in the following (we're using the User struct from above,
but making the name field optional):

    //@ serialize
    struct User
    {
        Poco::Optional<std::string> name;
        Poco::Optional<std::string> password;
        Poco::Optional<std::set<std::string>> permissions;
        Poco::Optional<std::set<std::string>> roles;
    };


    //@ remote
    //@ path="/api/1.0/users"
    class UserCollectionEndpoint
    {
    public:
        UserCollectionEndpoint(/* ... */);
        ~UserCollectionEndpoint();

        User post(const User& user);
            /// Create a new user.

        //@ $maxResults={in=query, optional}
        //@ $start={in=query, optional}
        std::vector<User> get(int maxResults = 0, int start = 0);
            /// Return a list of user objects, starting with
            /// the given start index, and return at most
            /// maxResults items.

    private:
        // ...
    };


    //@ remote
    //@ path="/api/1.0/users/{name}"
    class UserEndpoint
    {
    public:
        UserEndpoint(/* ... */);
        ~UserEndpoint();

        //@ $name={in=path}
        User put(const std::string& name, const User& user);
            /// Update a user (calls patch()).

        //@ $name={in=path}
        User patch(const std::string& name, const User& user);
            /// Update a user.

        //@ $name={in=path}
        User get(const std::string& name);
            /// Retrieve a user by name.

        //@ $name={in=path}
        void delete_(const std::string& name);
            /// Delete a user.

    private:
        // ...
    };
----

What can be seen in the above code samples is that we only have to implement member
functions for the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) that our API supports.
We don't have to deal with the details of parsing or creating JSON, or handling request
URIs and query strings, or the intricacies of HTTP requests.
The Remoting REST framework does all these things automatically, using code generated by
the Remoting code generator, based on the annotations in the header files.

For example, for the UserCollectionEndpoint::post() method, the parameter is automatically
serialized and deserialized to/from JSON, whereas for UserEndpoint::put(), the name of
the user is extracted from the request path (note the placeholder {name} in the path
annotation). Parameters passed in a query can also be handled, as seen in
UserCollectionEndpoint::get(). Query parameters can be made optional by specifying the
`optional` attribute for the parameter. Parameters can also be passed in HTTP request/response
headers or in a form. Furthermore, HTTP authentication (basic, digest, token/bearer) is supported,
as well as HTTPS.


!!Parameters

In general, in RESTful web services, parameters can be passed in the following locations:

  - request/response body, using JSON or raw format
  - query strings
  - form data in request body
  - request path
  - HTTP request/response headers

Non-scalar values can only be passed in request or response body, using JSON format.
Scalar values can be passed in any part of the request or response. The location
and format of parameters is specified using REST-specific
[[00300-RemotingNGAttributesReference.html Remoting NG attributes]].


!!Resource Paths

The default Remoting NG resource path (/rest/<*class*>/<*object*>) is not really well
suited for RESTful web service endpoints. Therefore, every endpoint class should
specify a proper path with the <[path]> attribute. The path can contain parameter
placeholders in the form of a parameter name enclosed in curly brackets.
Resource paths specified on an endpoint object using the <[path]> attribute will
automatically be registered as alias paths with the ORB when the respective
<*RemoteObject*> is registered using the generated <*ServerHelper*>.


!!!Working With RESTful Web Services

Setting up a server to provide a RESTful web service works the same as with the
other Remoting NG transports. Again the first step is setting up and optionally
configuring the REST Listener instance (Poco::RemotingNG::REST::Listener).
Then, endpoints can be registered using the Listener.

    // create and register REST listener
    Poco::RemotingNG::REST::Listener::Ptr pListener = new Poco::RemotingNG::REST::Listener("0.0.0.0:8080");
    std::string listener = Poco::RemotingNG::ORB::instance().registerListener(pListener);

    // register endpoints
    std::string userCollectionEndpointURI = UserCollectionEndpointServerHelper::registerObject(
        new UserCollectionEndpoint(/* ... */), "endpoint", listener);
    std::string userEndpointURI = UserEndpointServerHelper::registerObject(
        new UserEndpoint(/* ... */), "endpoint", listener);
----

Since the default Remoting NG resource path (in the above example,
"/rest/UserCollectionEndpoint/endpoint" and "/rest/UserEndpoint/endpoint")
will not be used by clients, the name of the service object passed to registerObject()
does not really matter, we simply use the name "endpoint" here. Any other (valid)
name would also be fine.

On the client side, invoking a RESTful web service using Remoting NG generated
code also involves the steps known from the previous tutorials.
First, the REST Transport Factory (Poco::RemotingNG::REST::TransportFactory) must be
registered. Then, the generated <*ClientHelper*> classes are used to create
proxy objects for the endpoints. One difference here is that since we're not using
the standard Remoting NG URI paths, we need to specify a second argument to the
<*ClientHelper*> to tell it we're going to use the REST Transport.

    // register transport
    Poco::RemotingNG::REST::TransportFactory::registerFactory();

    // get proxies for remote objects
    IUserCollectionEndpoint::Ptr pUserCollection = UserCollectionEndpointClientHelper::find(
        "http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/users", "rest");
    IUserEndpoint::Ptr pUser = UserEndpointClientHelper::find(
        "http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/users/{name}", "rest");
----

The URI path specified in the call to <[*ClientHelper::find()]> should be the same
that's specified in the endpoint class using the <[path]> attribute, even if it contains
placeholders.


!!!Generating OpenAPI (Swagger) Documents

The <*RemoteGenNG*> tool supports the creation of [[https://www.openapis.org OpenAPI]]
specifications (also known as Swagger documents).
The OpenAPI specification is a broadly adopted industry standard
for describing RESTful APIs. Version 3.0 of the specification is supported.

An OpenAPI specification document can be used to generate documentation
for an API, or to generate client and server code for implementing the API with
different programming languages and libraries.

In order to enable generation of an OpenAPI document, a few elements must be
added to the <*RemoteGenNG*> configuration file. Most OpenAPI-related
elements are optional, but three elements must be provided:

  - <*output/openAPI/path*>: This setting specifies the path and file name of the OpenAPI
    specification file. This setting will also enable generation of the OpenAPI
    specification file.
  - <*output/openAPI/info/title*>: This setting specifies the title of the API,
    which is a required part of an OpenAPI document.
  - <*output/openAPI/server/url*>: This setting specifies the URL of the
    server providing the API.

Here is an example <*openAPI*> fragment:

    <openAPI>
        <path>openapi/api.json</path>
        <info>
            <title>Sample REST API</title>
            <description>An example for a RESTful API.</description>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
            <contact>
                <name>Applied Informatics Software Engineering GmbH</name>
                <url>https://pocoproject.org/pro/</url>
            </contact>
        </info>
        <server>
            <url>http://localhost:8080/</url>
        </server>
    </openAPI>
----

OpenAPI documents can only be generated for services that follow the RESTful
style required by the RemotingNG REST Transport.

This concludes the Remoting NG tutorials. Please look at the sample applications
provided with Remoting NG for more examples showing how to invoke RESTful
web services.
