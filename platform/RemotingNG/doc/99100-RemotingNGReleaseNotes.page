Remoting NG Release Notes
Remoting NG

!!!Release 2014.1B

!!Summary of Changes

  - Added support for cookies to JSONRPC and SOAP Transport objects.
  - Make HTTPServerRequest and HTTPServerResponse objects available
    to server code via Context in JSONRPC and SOAP transports.
  - RemoteGen: SingletonHolder in client/server helper is now named sh<class> to avoid 
    name conflicts if multiple source files are combined.


!!!Release 2014.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Minor changes for compatibility with C++11.
  - TCP transport bugfix: Set up reply stream before closing request to avoid
    race condition (no reply handler registered) with fast connections.
  - RemoteGen: Do not use inheritance in generated skeleton classes.
    This fixes a potential crash when invoking a base class method on a
    derived class, due to a failing cross cast (the RemoteObject classes for
    base class and derived classes are not related).
  - New ServerHelper class template, which is specialized by generated ServerHelper 
    classes. This allows use of ServerHelper classes in generic code.
  - ServerHelper and ClientHelper instances are now created using a Poco::SingletonHolder.
  - Various minor improvements.
  

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2013.2

!!Summary of Changes

  - Added the Poco::RemotingNG::Context class which allows to pass transport-specific
    information to service methods via a thread-local object.
  - Added the JSON-RPC transport which implements the 
    [[http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification JSON-RPC 2.0]] protocol
  - XSDGen bugfixes: empty import elements now work, unnamed inner simple type declarations 
    are handled properly and no longer cause an assertion, missing element declarations 
    no longer cause a crash due to a null pointer.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2013.1p1

!!Summary of Changes

  - The SOAP transport now correctly handles SOAP faults sent in MTOM multipart messages.
  - The TypeDeserializer for Poco::DateTime now also parses the time zone, if present, 
    and adjusts the resulting DateTime value accordingly.
  - Fixed a RemoteGen bug where the @header attribute was ignored in case of a renamed
    method parameter.
  - Fixed a XSDGen bug where header elements would be duplicated in generated C++ classes
    if both SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 bindings were present in a WSDL document.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2013.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - The Content-Type HTTP header for a MTOM multipart request had compatibility issues
    with some third party implementations. This is now fixed.
  - Fixed a crasher with serializing MTOM messages if a Serializer instance was used
    multiple times.
  - Fixed a few XSD/WSDL code generation issues, causing incorrect code to be generated
    for certain XSD/WSDL constructs.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2012.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Remoting NG is the successor to the Remoting framework.
  - This is the first official release of Remoting NG. While
    Remoting NG was included starting with release 2011.1 as
    part of the Universal Plug and Play framework, with release
    2012.1, Remoting NG completely replaces the older Remoting
    framework, which will no longer be improved.
  - Remoting NG features an improved internal architecture, support
    for remote events, and new transports. Also included is
    code generation from WSDL documents.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The transition from Remoting to Remoting NG requires some
    changes to existing code.
  - The generated client helper classes now only have a <*find()*>
    method taking a URI as argument.
  - The programming interfaces for registering listeners and
    service objects with the server ORB have changed. The generated
    server helper classes have a different interface as well.
  - The attribute syntax for method parameters has changed.
  - Please refer to the documentation for more information.
