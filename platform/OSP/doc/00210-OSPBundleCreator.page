OSP Bundle Creator

!!! The Bundle Creator Tool

The Bundle Creator Tool is used to create Zip-compressed bundle files, using a
bundle specification file as input. While bundles can also be created manually,
by building a well-defined directory hierarchy and optionally packing it into
a Zip file with an utility like <*WinZip*>, creating bundle files in a fully
automated way is far less error prone.


!! The Bundle Specification File

To know what to do, the Bundle Creator Tool needs a bundle specification file as
input. A bundle specification file usually has the extension <[.bndlspec]>, although
this is not mandatory.

The bundle specification file contains the necessary information to build the 
bundle's manifest, a list of all shared libraries that become part of the bundle,
and a list of all resource and data files that become part of the bundle.
A simple XML file format is used.

Following is an example for a bundle specification file:

  <bundlespec>
      <manifest>
          <name>Greeter Sample</name>
          <symbolicName>com.appinf.osp.samples.greeter</symbolicName>
          <version>1.0.0</version>
          <vendor>Applied Informatics</vendor>
          <copyright>(c) 2007, Applied Informatics Software Engineering GmbH</copyright>
          <activator>
              <class>GreeterBundleActivator</class>
              <library>Greeter</library>
          </activator>
          <lazyStart>false</lazyStart>
          <runLevel>400</runLevel>
          <dependency>
              <symbolicName>com.appinf.osp.samples.greetingservice</symbolicName>
              <version>1.0.0</version>
          </dependency>
      </manifest>
      <code>
          bin/*.dll,
          bin/*.pdb,
          bin/${osName}/${osArch}/*.so,
          bin/${osName}/${osArch}/*.dylib
      </code>
      <files>
      </files>
  </bundlespec>


!! Bundle Specification Elements

! The bundlespec Element

The <[bundlespec]> element is the XML root element in a bundle specification.
It is mandatory.


! The manifest Element

The <[manifest]> element is used to specify the bundle's manifest data.
It is mandatory.


! The name Element

The <[name]> element specifies the bundle's user-readable name.
It is mandatory. Instead of a fixed name, the <[name]> element
can contain a reference to a bundle property (e.g., <[${bundleName}]>).
This property must be defined in the bundle's <[bundle.properties]>
file.


! The symbolicName Element

The <[symbolicName]> element specifies the bundle's symbolic name.
Is is mandatory.


! The version Element

The <[version]> element specifies the bundle's version.
Is is mandatory.


! The vendor Element

The <[vendor]> element specifies the name of the organization
providing the bundle.
It is optional. Instead of a fixed name, the <[vendor]> element
can contain a reference to a bundle property (e.g., <[${vendorName}]>).
This property must be defined in the bundle's <[bundle.properties]>
file.


! The copyright Element

The <[copyright]> element specifies the bundle's copyright information.
It is optional. Instead of a fixed string, the <[copyright]> element
can contain a reference to a bundle property (e.g., <[${copyrightInfo}]>).
This property must be defined in the bundle's <[bundle.properties]>
file.


! The activator Element

The <[activator]> element specifies the name of the class implementing
the bundle's activator in the <[class]> sub element, and optionally the name 
of the shared library containing the bundle activator in the <[library]>
subelement. The extension of the shared library (e.g., <[.dll]> or
<[.so]> must be omitted from the library name.
The element is optional.


! The lazyStart Element

The <[lazyStart]> element specifies whether <*lazy start*> should be
enabled for the bundle. It is optional. Valid values are <[true]> or
<[false]>.


! The runLevel Element

The <[runLevel]> element specifies the bundle's run level. It is optional.


! The dependency Element

The <[dependency]> element specifies the bundles that this bundle requires
to function. The symbolic name of a required bundle is specified in the
<[symbolicName]> sub element. The required version of the bundle is
specified in the <[version]> sub element.

The <[dependency]> element can occur zero or more times.


! The extends Element

The optional <[extends]> element makes the bundle an extension bundle and
specifies the bundle that this bundle extends.
The symbolic name of the extended bundle must be specified in the element.

The <[extends]> element can occur at most once.


! The code Element

The <[code]> element contains a comma-separated list of shared libraries that
must be part of the bundle. Glob expressions (see Poco::Glob) can be used.
Also, the properties <[osName]> and <[osArch]> can be used.

Shared libraries that cannot be found are ignored. This allows you to use
the same bundle specification on different platforms.

This element is optional.


! The files Element

The <[files]> element contains a comma-separated list of files that must be
part of the bundle. Glob expressions (see Poco::Glob) can be used.
Directories are copied recursively.

This element is optional.


!!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool

The Bundle Creator Tool takes the file name of the Bundle Specification file
as argument. Optionally, the <[/output]> (Windows) or <[--output]>/<[-o]> (Unix)
option can be used to specify the directory where the bundle file should be
created. For more information, invoke the <[bundle]> command with the
<[/help]> or <[--help]> option.


!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool from Visual Studio

It is convenient to invoke the Bundle Creator Tool directly from
Visual Studio, as part of the bundle's build process.
To do this, add a command that invokes the Bundle Creator Tool to
the Post-Build Event of the project, as shown below.

!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool from a Makefile

The Bundle Creator tool can be invoked from a Makefile platforms as part of the build process.
If the GNU Make based build system from the POCO C++ Libraries is used, the Bundle Creator tool invocation
can be done as a post-build step. A post-build step can be defined by assigning a command to
the <[postbuild]> Make variable, as shown below.


    BUNDLE_TOOL = $(POCO_BASE)/OSP/BundleCreator/$(BINDIR)/bundle
    
    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/global
    
    objects = Greeter
    
    target         = com.appinf.osp.samples.greeter
    target_version = 1
    target_libs    = PocoOSP PocoUtil PocoXML PocoFoundation
    
    postbuild      = $(BUNDLE_TOOL) -o../bundles Greeter.bndlspec
    
    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/dylib

!! Bundles and Cross-Compiling for Embedded Linux

When building bundles for a target system with a different processor architecture than the host system
(cross-compiling), a few things must be taken care of. First, inside a bundle, executable code (shared
libraries) are stored in a directory with the path <[bin/<osname>/<osarch>]>, where <[<osname>]>
specified the operating sytem name (in case of an embedded Linux system, this is <[Linux]>), and
<[<osarch>]> specifies the processor architecture. The processor architecture must match the
output of the command <[uname -m]> on the target system.

This can be accomplished in two ways. The first is to use a bundle specification file where,
at the <[code]> element, you explicitely specify the target operating system name and architecture
using the <[platform]> attribute. Example:

      <code platform="Linux/armv5tejl">
          bin/Linux/armv5tejl/*.so
      </code>
----

Alternatively, you can omit the <[platform]> attribute, and instead specify the target operating
system name and architecture as command line arguments to the Bundle Creator tool. This is done
using the <[--osname]> (or <[-n]>), and <[--osarch]> (or <[-a]>) command line arguments.

Note that when cross-compiling an OSP application, you must build the POCO and OSP libraries and
executables twice -- once for the host system, and once for the target system. When using the
build system from the POCO C++ Libraries, libraries and executables for both the host and
the target system(s) can be kept in parallel. To support cross-compiling a bundle, the
Makefile for building a bundle using the POCO build system must be modified as follows:

    BUNDLE_TOOL = $(POCO_BASE)/OSP/BundleCreator/bin/$(POCO_HOST_OSNAME)/$(POCO_HOST_OSARCH)/bundle
    
    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/global
    
    objects = Greeter
    
    target         = com.appinf.osp.samples.greeter
    target_version = 1
    target_libs    = PocoOSP PocoUtil PocoXML PocoFoundation
    
    postbuild      = $(BUNDLE_TOOL) -o../bundles Greeter.bndlspec -a$(OSARCH)
    
    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/dylib
