OSP Bundle Creator
Open Service Platform

!!! The Bundle Creator Tool

The Bundle Creator Tool is used to create Zip-compressed bundle files, using a
bundle specification file as input. While bundles can also be created manually,
by building a well-defined directory hierarchy and optionally packing it into
a Zip file with an utility like <*WinZip*>, creating bundle files in a fully
automated way is far less error prone.


!! The Bundle Specification File

To know what to do, the Bundle Creator tool needs a bundle specification file as
input. A bundle specification file usually has the extension <[.bndlspec]>, although
this is not mandatory.

The bundle specification file contains the necessary information to build the
bundle's manifest, a list of all shared libraries that become part of the bundle,
and a list of all resource and data files that become part of the bundle.
A simple XML file format is used.

Following is an example for a bundle specification file:

  <bundlespec>
      <manifest>
          <name>Greeter Sample</name>
          <symbolicName>com.appinf.osp.samples.greeter</symbolicName>
          <version>1.0.0</version>
          <vendor>Applied Informatics</vendor>
          <copyright>(c) Applied Informatics Software Engineering GmbH</copyright>
          <activator>
              <class>GreeterBundleActivator</class>
              <library>Greeter</library>
          </activator>
          <lazyStart>false</lazyStart>
          <runLevel>400</runLevel>
          <dependency>
              <symbolicName>com.appinf.osp.samples.greetingservice</symbolicName>
              <version>1.0.0</version>
          </dependency>
      </manifest>
      <code>
          bin/*.dll,
          bin/*.pdb,
          bin/${osName}/${osArch}/*.so,
          bin/${osName}/${osArch}/*.dylib
      </code>
      <files>
      </files>
  </bundlespec>


!! Bundle Specification Elements

! The bundlespec Element

The <[bundlespec]> element is the XML root element in a bundle specification.
It is mandatory.


! The manifest Element

The <[manifest]> element is used to specify the bundle's manifest data.
It is mandatory.


! The name Element

The <[name]> element specifies the bundle's user-readable name.
It is mandatory. Instead of a fixed name, the <[name]> element
can contain a reference to a bundle property (e.g., <[${bundleName}]>).
This property must be defined in the bundle's <[bundle.properties]>
file.


! The symbolicName Element

The <[symbolicName]> element specifies the bundle's symbolic name.
Is is mandatory.


! The version Element

The <[version]> element specifies the bundle's version.
Is is mandatory.


! The vendor Element

The <[vendor]> element specifies the name of the organization
providing the bundle.
It is optional. Instead of a fixed name, the <[vendor]> element
can contain a reference to a bundle property (e.g., <[${vendorName}]>).
This property must be defined in the bundle's <[bundle.properties]>
file.


! The copyright Element

The <[copyright]> element specifies the bundle's copyright information.
It is optional. Instead of a fixed string, the <[copyright]> element
can contain a reference to a bundle property (e.g., <[${copyrightInfo}]>).
This property must be defined in the bundle's <[bundle.properties]>
file.


! The activator Element

The <[activator]> element specifies the name of the class implementing
the bundle's activator in the <[class]> sub element, and optionally the name
of the shared library containing the bundle activator in the <[library]>
subelement. The extension of the shared library (e.g., <[.dll]> or
<[.so]> must be omitted from the library name.
The element is optional.


! The lazyStart Element

The <[lazyStart]> element specifies whether <*lazy start*> should be
enabled for the bundle. It is optional. Valid values are <[true]> or
<[false]>.


! The preventUninstall Element

The optional <[preventUninstall]> element specifies whether the bundle should
prevent being uninstalled at run-time. Valid values are <[true]> or <[false]>.


! The runLevel Element

The <[runLevel]> element specifies the bundle's run level. It is optional.


! The dependency Element

The <[dependency]> element specifies the bundles that this bundle requires
to function. The symbolic name of a required bundle is specified in the
<[symbolicName]> sub element. The required version of the bundle is
specified in the <[version]> sub element.

The <[dependency]> element can occur zero or more times.


! The module Element

The <[module]> element specifies the modules that this bundle provides.
The symbolic name of a provided module is specified in the
<[symbolicName]> sub element. The provided version of the module is
specified in the <[version]> sub element.

The <[module]> element can occur zero or more times.


! The module-dependency Element

The <[module-dependency]> element specifies the modules that this bundle requires
to function. The symbolic name of a required module is specified in the
<[symbolicName]> sub element. The required version of the module is
specified in the <[version]> sub element.

The <[module-dependency]> element can occur zero or more times.


! The extends Element

The optional <[extends]> element makes the bundle an extension bundle and
specifies the bundle that this bundle extends.
The symbolic name of the extended bundle must be specified in the element.

The <[extends]> element can occur at most once.


! The code Element

The <[code]> element contains a comma-separated list of shared libraries that
must be part of the bundle. Glob expressions (see Poco::Glob) can be used.
Also, the properties <[osName]> and <[osArch]> can be used.

Shared libraries that cannot be found are ignored. This allows you to use
the same bundle specification on different platforms.

This element is optional.

If the `--code` (or `/code`) option is specified on the command-line when
invoking the Bundle Creator tool, the value specified on the command-line
fully overrides this element.


! The files Element

The <[files]> element contains a comma-separated list of files that must be
part of the bundle. Glob expressions (see Poco::Glob) can be used.
Directories are copied recursively.

This element is optional.


!!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool

The Bundle Creator tool takes the file name of the Bundle Specification file
as argument. Optionally, the <[/output]> (Windows) or <[--output]>/<[-o]> (Unix)
option can be used to specify the directory where the bundle file should be
created. The following command-line options are supported:

  - `-h`, `--help`, `/help`: Display help information on command line arguments.
  - `-o <dir>`, `--output-dir <dir>`, `/output-dir=<dir>`:
    Specify the directory where the bundle is saved.
  - `-k`, `--keep-bundle-dir`, `/keep-bundle-dir`:
    Keep intermediary bundle directory.
  - `-d`, `--bundle-dir-only`, `--bundle-dir-only`:
    Create bundle directory only, no bundle (.bndl) file
    (implies `-d`).
  - `-n <osname>`, `--osname <osname>`, `/osname=<osname>`:
    Specify default target operating system name (e.g., "Linux").
    This is mostly useful when cross-compiling.
  - `-a <osarch>`, `--osarch <osarch>`, `/osarch=<osarch>`:
    Specify default target operating system architecture
    (e.g., "x86_64" or "armv7l").
  - `-N [<extensions>]`, `--no-deflate [<extensions>]`, `/no-deflate[=<extensions>]`:
    Do not compress (deflate) files in bundle file. If a comma-separated
    list of extensions is specified, only files with these extensions are
    stored uncompressed.
  - `-v <version>`, `--version <version>`, `/version=<version>`:
    Specify default bundle version, e.g. "1.0.0", to be used if the bundle
    specification file does not have one.
  - `-D <name>=<value>`, `--define <name>=<value>`, `/define=<name>=<value>`:
    Define a configuration property. A configuration property defined with
    this option can be referenced in the bundle specification file, using
    the following syntax: `${<name>}`.
  - `-c <glob>{;<glob>}`, `--code <glob>{;<glob>}`, `/code=<glob>{;<glob>}`:
    Specify executable files to include in the bundle's bin directory. If
    specified, overrides the <code> element in the bundle specification
    file. Value is a comma- or semicolon-separated list of file names or
    glob expressions. Can be specified multiple times.


!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool from Visual Studio

It is convenient to invoke the Bundle Creator tool directly from
Visual Studio, as part of the bundle's build process.
To do this, add a command that invokes the Bundle Creator tool to
the Post-Build Event of the project, as shown below.

!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool from a Makefile

The Bundle Creator tool can be invoked from a Makefile platforms as part of the build process.
If the GNU Make based build system from the POCO C++ Libraries is used, the Bundle Creator tool invocation
can be done as a post-build step. A post-build step can be defined by assigning a command to
the <[postbuild]> Make variable, as shown below.


    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/global
    include $(POCO_BASE)/OSP/BundleCreator/BundleCreator.make

    objects = Greeter

    target         = com.appinf.osp.samples.greeter
    target_version = 1
    target_libs    = PocoOSP PocoUtil PocoXML PocoFoundation

    postbuild      = $(BUNDLE_TOOL) -o../bundles Greeter.bndlspec

    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/dylib
----


!! Invoking the Bundle Creator Tool from CMake

As part of the CMake build system support, a custom function `poco_osp_bundle`
is provided, which takes care of invoking the Bundle Creator tool appropriately.
The function is defined in `PocoOSPHelpers.cmake`, which can be found in the
top-level `cmake` directory. An example `CMakeLists.txt` for building a bundle
is shown below:

    set(TARGET "com.appinf.osp.samples.servicelistener")
    set(BUNDLE_SPEC "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ServiceListener.bndlspec")

    set(TARGET_BINDIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/bin/$<CONFIG>)
    set(BUNDLE_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bundles)

    # Sources
    file(GLOB SRCS "src/*.cpp")

    # Dynamic Library
    add_library(${TARGET} MODULE ${SRCS})
    set_target_properties(${TARGET}
        PROPERTIES
        LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${TARGET_BINDIR}"
        PREFIX ""
    )

    # On macOS, use .dylib instead of .so
    if(${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} STREQUAL "Darwin")
        set_target_properties(${TARGET} PROPERTIES SUFFIX ".dylib")
    endif()

    target_link_libraries(${TARGET} Poco::OSP Poco::Zip Poco::Util Poco::XML Poco::JSON Poco::Foundation)

    # Build Bundle
    add_dependencies(${TARGET} BundleCreator)
    poco_osp_bundle(${TARGET}-bundle
        DEPENDS ${LIBNAME} ${TARGET}
        SPEC ${BUNDLE_SPEC}
        CODE $<TARGET_FILE:${TARGET}>
        DESTINATION ${BUNDLE_DIR}
    )

    install(
        DIRECTORY ${BUNDLE_DIR}
        DESTINATION lib${LIB_SUFFIX}/bundles
    )
----

With CMake, it's recommended to specify the binaries that should go into the bundle
on the command-line and not in the bundle specification file's `<code>` element,
as shown in the above example. Note that the above `CMakeLists.txt` file is
intended to be referenced by a higher-level `CMakeLists.txt`, which would also
include the `PocoOSPHelpers.cmake` file containing the `poco_osp_bundle` function.


!! Bundles and Cross-Compiling for Embedded Linux

When building bundles for a target system with a different processor architecture than the host system
(cross-compiling), a few things must be taken care of. First, inside a bundle, executable code (shared
libraries) are stored in a directory with the path <[bin/<osname>/<osarch>]>, where <[<osname>]>
specified the operating sytem name (in case of an embedded Linux system, this is <[Linux]>), and
<[<osarch>]> specifies the processor architecture. The processor architecture must match the
output of the command <[uname -m]> on the target system.

This can be accomplished in two ways. The first is to use a bundle specification file where,
at the <[code]> element, you explicitely specify the target operating system name and architecture
using the <[platform]> attribute. Example:

      <code platform="Linux/armv5tejl">
          bin/Linux/armv5tejl/*.so
      </code>
----

Alternatively, you can omit the <[platform]> attribute, and instead specify the target operating
system name and architecture as command line arguments to the Bundle Creator tool. This is done
using the <[--osname]> (or <[-n]>), and <[--osarch]> (or <[-a]>) command line arguments.

Note that when cross-compiling an OSP application, you must build the POCO and OSP libraries and
executables twice -- once for the host system, and once for the target system. When using the
build system from the POCO C++ Libraries, libraries and executables for both the host and
the target system(s) can be kept in parallel. To support cross-compiling a bundle, the
Makefile for building a bundle using the POCO build system must be modified as follows:

    BUNDLE_TOOL = $(POCO_BASE)/OSP/BundleCreator/bin/$(POCO_HOST_OSNAME)/$(POCO_HOST_OSARCH)/bundle

    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/global

    objects = Greeter

    target         = com.appinf.osp.samples.greeter
    target_version = 1
    target_libs    = PocoOSP PocoUtil PocoXML PocoFoundation

    postbuild      = $(BUNDLE_TOOL) -o../bundles Greeter.bndlspec -a$(OSARCH)

    include $(POCO_BASE)/build/rules/dylib
----

!! Stripping Shared Libraries and Executables

Some build systems, e.g. Yocto, build all shared libraries and executables with debug
symbols and only remove (strip) the debug symbols in a later install or packaging step.
This is too late for use with the Bundle Creator tool, which means that bundles
would contain shared libraries and executables with debug information. This is 
undesirable, especially for use on embedded systems with limited resources.

To solve this issue, the Bundle Creator tool can optionally strip debug symbols
from all shared libraries and executables incorporated into a bundle (via the
<[code]> element in the bundle specification file, or the respective command-line option). 
This happens after the files have been copied into the temporary directory from which they 
are copied into the bundle. Therefore the original files are not modified.

To enable this feature, the <[--strip]> (or <[/strip]> on Windows) command-line option
can be used. The name of the strip tool (usually <[strip]>, with the usual prefix for cross-compiling)
must be specified. Alternatively, the environment variable <[BUNDLE_STRIP]> can be set
to the name of the tool.
