OSP User Authentication and Authorization
Open Service Platform

!!! Introduction

The Open Service Platform provides some basic support for user authentication and authorization,
based on the Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService interface. The OSP core library itself does not provide
an implementation of the <[AuthService]> interface. A very simple implementation of the interface
is provided by the <*SimpleAuthService*> sample, found in the <[OSP/samples]> directory.

Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService only defines two methods, <[authenticate()]> and <[authorize()]>.
The former method is used to authenticate an user based on a user name and credentials/password
combination. The latter one is used to verify that a given user has a certain permission.

!!! Authentication

Authentication in OSP is based on user name and credentials. In the simplest case, the credentials
used to authenticate a user consist of a simple password. However, more complex schemes (e.g., based
on certificates) are theoretically possible. An implementation of the <[AuthService]> normally
is based on a database of user names and passwords. The <[authenticate()]> member function of
a subclass of <[Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService]> has to verify that the given combination of
user name and credentials is a valid one. The <[authenticate()]> member function is defined
as follows:

    bool authenticate(const std::string& userName, const std::string& credentials) const;
----

!!! Authorization

Authorization in OSP is based on the concept of permissions. In OSP, a permission is a simple string
denoting a certain privilege. The <[authorize()]> method of Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService checks
whether a user identified by a user name has a certain permission. How user names and permissions
are associated is up to the actual implementation of <[AuthService]>. The possibilities range from
a simple configuration file specifying the permissions for each user name to a sophisticated
authorization concept based on user groups and roles.
For the most part, OSP does not care about user permissions. For example, the Web bundle allows
to specify a required permission for accessing a certain path on the server. How the permission
is named is not of interest to the Web library -- it simply checks that the user (obtained from
HTTP Basic authentication) has the specified permission.

The <[authorize()]> member function is defined as follows:

    bool authorize(const std::string& userName, const std::string& permission) const;
----


!!! The SimpleAuthService Sample

A very simple implementation of <[AuthService]> can be found found in the
<[OSP/samples/SimpleAuthService]> directory.

The <[SimpleAuthService]> only knows two users -- "user" and "admin".
Any password is valid for "user". The password for "admin"
can be set (as clear text) in the global configuration file with the
"adminPassword" property, e.g.:

	adminPassword = s3cr3t
----

If no password has been set in the global configuration file, a default
password (stored in the bundle's properties) is used.
The default password is "admin".
The "admin" user has all permissions. The set of permissions
for "user" can be set in the global configuration file,
using the "userPermissions" property. The permissions are
specified as a comma-separated list, e.g.

    userPermissions = somePermission, someOtherPermission
----

The service is registered under the service name "osp.auth" and
can be obtained using the Poco::OSP::ServiceFinder helper class:

    Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService::Ptr pAuthService =
        Poco::OSP::ServiceFinder::findByName<Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService>(pContext, "osp.auth");
----


!!! Database and LDAP-based Authentication - The AuthAdminService

Starting with release 2014.1, OSP comes with a new and extended implementation of the
<[AuthService]>. The new service is called <[AuthAdminService]> and is defined and
implemented in the <[com.appinf.osp.auth]> bundle. As its name implies the service
not only provides the <[authenticate()]> and <[authorize()]> methods known from
the <[Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService]>, it also provides methods for managing
user accounts and permissions. There is also a shell command available for managing
users, roles and permissions. The AuthAdminService requires a commercial license.

The following features are supported:
  * User and role-based permission grants.
  * User accounts and permissions are stored in a SQL Database (other database
    types can be supported as well).
  * LDAP server integration. Users can be authenticated via an LDAP server and
    permissions and roles can be assigned via LDAP attributes.
  * In-memory caching of password hashes and permissions.

User authentication and authorization is based on the concepts of users, roles and
permissions. Every user account can be assigned a list of permissions and a list of roles.
Every role can be assigned a list of permissions as well.
The effective permissions of a user are the permissions directly granted to him,
as well as the permissions granted via its assigned roles.


!! Setting up the Authentication/Authorization Database

The default <[AuthAdminService]> implementation in the <[com.appinf.osp.auth.data]>
bundle uses a SQL database for managing users, roles and
permissions. In order to use the service, a database must be set up and the
service must be configured to use a specific database. The Data library from
the POCO C++ Libraries is used for database access, therefore the service
is independent from the underlying database engine. ODBC, MySQL and SQLite
can be used.

Following is the database schema required by the <[AuthAdminService]>:

    CREATE TABLE auth_user
    (
        username VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE auth_role
    (
        rolename VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY
    );

    CREATE TABLE auth_user_roles
    (
        username VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_user(username) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        rolename VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_role(rolename) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );

    CREATE TABLE auth_user_permissions
    (
        username VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_user(username) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        permission VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE auth_role_permissions
    (
        rolename VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_role(rolename) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        permission VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE auth_user_attributes
    (
        username VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_user(username) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        attribute VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
        value VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
    );
----

After setting up the tables, at least one initial user account must be created.
Usually, this will be an administrator account with the necessary permissions to
perform further administrative tasks using the OSP Shell service.

The following statement creates a user named "admin" with password "admin":

    INSERT INTO auth_user VALUES("admin", "3d29e163b9107fcb31077b45b47026e2");
----

The password is not stored in clear text in the database. Only a salted hash of the
password is stored. The salted hash of the password is computed by concatenating
the salt with the password and computing the MD5:

    passwordHash = MD5(salt | password)
----

The salt can be configured in the bundle.properties file in the <[com.appinf.osp.auth.data]>
bundle (property <[auth.passwordSalt]>) and should be unique for each application.

On Linux systems, the has can be computed with the md5sum command:

    $ echo -n "saltpassword" | md5sum
----

On OS X and BSD systems, the md5 utility can be used:

    $ md5 -s "saltpassword"
----

<!Important!>: MD5 hashes are no longer considered secure. However, newer versions
of the AuthAdminService use a more secure hashing algorithm (PBKDF2), and the initial
MD5 password hash will be automatically upgraded upon the first successful login.
Nevertheless, only the initial account should be created this way.

The following permissions used by OSP should be granted to the administrator:

  * bundleAdmin: allow access to the <*BundleAdmin*> web application.
  * authAdmin: allow access to the <[auth]> Shell command.

This can be done with the following SQL statements:

    INSERT INTO auth_user_permissions VALUES("admin", "bundleAdmin");
    INSERT INTO auth_user_permissions VALUES("admin", "authAdmin");
----

Instead of granting the permissions directly to the user account, a role
can be used instead. In this case, the permissions are granted to the role, and
then the role is assigned to one or more user accounts:

    INSERT INTO auth_role VALUES("systemAdmin");
    INSERT INTO auth_role_permissions VALUES("systemAdmin", "bundleAdmin");
    INSERT INTO auth_role_permissions VALUES("systemAdmin", "authAdmin");
    INSERT INTO auth_user_roles VALUES("admin", "systemAdmin");
----

After the database tables have been set up, the service must be configured.


!! Configuring the AuthAdminService

The <[AuthAdminService]> default implementation in the <[com.appinf.osp.auth.data]> bundle
is configured using the global application configuration file. At least the
<*auth.db.connector*> and <*auth.db.connectionString*> configuration
properties must be specified.

The following configuration properties are available:

  * auth.db.connector
  * auth.db.connectionString
  * auth.cacheSize
  * auth.cacheTimeout
  * auth.hashVersion
  * auth.saltLength
  * auth.pbkdf2Iterations
  * auth.credentialsSalt
  * auth.ldap.uri
  * auth.ldap.bindDN
  * auth.ldap.permissionAttribute
  * auth.ldap.roleAttribute
  * auth.ldap.extraAttributes


! auth.db.connector

This setting specifies which SQL database backend to use for accessing the database.
Valid values are "ODBC", "MySQL" and "SQLite".
The respective POCO Data bundle (poco.data.odbc, poco.data.mysql or poco.data.sqlite) must
be available as well.

If this setting is not specified, the <[AuthAdminService]> will be disabled.


! auth.db.connectionString

This setting specifies the connection string for connecting to the specific database
instance. For SQLite, this is simply the path of the database file to use.
For MySQL, the format of this string is:

    user=<username>;password=<password>;db=<database>;compress=true|false;auto-reconnect=true|false
----

For ODBC, please refer to your system's ODBC documentation for obtaining the connection string.


! auth.cacheSize

This setting allows configuring the maximum number of entries in the
internal permissions cache. This is used to reduce database accesses for
user authorization and thus speed up operation. Default is 1024. Should
be at least the number of maximum concurrent users expected on the
system.


! auth.cacheTimeout

This setting allows configuring the timeout of the password cache. The
password cache is used to reduce database accesses or LDAP lookups (if
LDAP authentication is enabled).


! auth.hashVersion

Specifies the version of the password hashing algorithm.

  - Version 1 uses MD5 with a global salt. This is considered insecure and should
    no longer be used.
  - Version 2 uses PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1 and per-user random salt (default).
  - Version 3 uses PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1 and per-user random salt with additional
    MD5 password hashing allowing implementation of secure challenge-response
    authentication mechanisms such as SCRAM-SHA1 (recommended).

New deployments should use Version 3. Also, existing deployments should be upgraded
to use this version. A user's hash will automatically be upgraded when the user
successfully authenticates. Note that the default version is 2; version 3 has to
be explicitly configured by setting the <[auth.hashVersion]> configuration property.


! auth.saltLength

The length of the generated per-user salt in bytes. Defaults to 7.


! auth.pbkdf2Rounds

The number of iterations for the PBKDF2 algorithm.
Defaults to 1024, but should be configured to 10000 for new deployments.
Note that existing Version 2 hashes cannot be validated anymore if this value is
changed. This does not affect Version 3 hashes.


! auth.credentialsSalt

An additional salt value for the Version 3 initial MD5 hash that is the input for
the main PBKDF2 hash. Defaults to "poco". Can be left at default value.
If changed while in deployment, Version 3 hashes cannot be validated anymore.


! auth.ldap.uri

If user authentication via LDAP is enabled, this setting specifies the
URI of the LDAP server to use. Example: <[ldap://ldap-server.company.com]>
(unencrypted connection) or <[ldaps://ldap-server.company.com]> (secure
connection).


! auth.ldap.bindDN

If user authentication via LDAP is enabled, this setting specifies the
distinguished name (DN) to bind to in order to authenticate a user. The
DN must contain a placeholder (%s), which will be replaced during
authentication with the actual username. Example:

    uid="%s",cn=users ,dc=orgunit,dc=company,dc=com
----

! auth.ldap.permissionAttribute

If user authentication via LDAP is enabled, this setting can be used to
configure the <[AuthAdminService]> to obtain user permissions from the LDAP
server. For that purpose, the LDAP server must provide permissions using
the LDAP attribute specified in this setting. If this setting is provided,
all user permissions in the database will be replaced with the
permissions provided by the LDAP server upon successful authentication.


! auth.ldap.roleAttribute

If user authentication via LDAP is enabled, this setting can be used to
configure the <[AuthAdminService]> to obtain user role assignments from the
LDAP server. For that purpose, the LDAP server must provide role names
using the attribute specified in this setting. If this setting is
provided, all user role assignments in the database will be replaced
with the roles provided by the LDAP server upon successful
authentication.


! auth.ldap.extraAttributes

If user authentication via LDAP is enabled, this setting can be used to
configure the <[AuthAdminService]> to obtain additional user attributes from the
LDAP server containing application-specific information. The attribute
names must be comma-separated. Once obtained from the LDAP server, the
attributes and their values can be queried using
the <[getUserAttribute()]> and <[attributesForUser()]> methods.

It is also possible to map an LDAP attribute name to a user attribute name,
by specifying both names separated by a colon. Example:

  auth.ldap.extraAttributes = givenname:firstName,surname:lastName
----

In the given example, the LDAP attribute <[givenname]> will be mapped to the
user attribute <[firstName]> and the LDAP attribute <[surname]> will be mapped
to <[lastName]>.


!! Using the AuthAdminService

The <[AuthAdminService]> provides methods for managing users, roles and permissions.
Please refer to the documentation of the Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService interface
and the Poco::OSP::Auth::Data::AuthAdminServiceImpl class for more information.

The <[AuthAdminService]> is registered under the service name "osp.auth" and
can be obtained using the Poco::OSP::ServiceFinder helper class:

    Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService::Ptr pAuthService =
        Poco::OSP::ServiceFinder::find<Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService>(pContext);
----


!! Managing Users, Roles and Permissions

In order to manage users, roles and permissions, the <*auth*> shell command is provided.
The command is implemented in the <*com.appinf.osp.auth.command*> bundle.

In order to use the <*auth*> command, the user must have the <*authAdmin*> permission.

From within the OSP Shell, enter <[auth]> command without arguments for a help screen.


! Creating a User Account

To create a user account, use the <*auth add user*> command and specify the
user name and its password as arguments. The following command will
create a user named alice with the password s3cr3t.

    osp> auth add user alice s3cr3t
----


! Granting a Permission to a User

To grant a permission to a user, use the <*auth grant user*> command, giving
the user name and permission as argument. For example, to grant user
alice access to the Bundle Administration Utility web application and related
shell commands:

    osp> auth grant user alice bundleAdmin
----


! Creating a Role

If multiple user accounts should have the same permissions, it makes
sense to define a role. This is done with the <*auth add role*> command. For
example, to define a role named <*superUsers*>:

    osp> auth add role superUsers
----


! Granting a Permission to a Role

To grant a permission to a role, use the <*auth grant role*> command, giving
the role name and permission as argument. For example, to grant role
<*superUsers*> access to the Bundle Administration Utility web application and related
shell commands:

    osp> auth grant role superUsers bundleAdmin
----


! Assigning a Role to a User

To assign a role to a user, use the <*auth assign*> command, giving the user
name and role name as arguments. For example, to assign user <*alice*> the
role <*superUsers*>:

    osp> auth assign alice superUsers
----


! Removing a Role From a User

To revoke a role from a user, use the <*auth unassign*> command, giving the
user name and role name as arguments. For example, to remove the role
<*superUsers*> from user <*alice*>:

    osp> auth unassign alice superUsers
----


! Revoking a Permission

A permission can be revoked from a user or role with the
<*auth revoke user*>, or <*auth revoke role*> command, respectively.
Specify the user or role name and permission as arguments. Example:

    osp> auth revoke user alice bundleAdmin
----


! Changing a User’s Password

To change a user’s password, use the <*auth passwd*> command, giving the
user name and new password as arguments. Example:

    osp> auth passwd alice sup3rs3cr3t
----


! Showing Information About Users, Roles and Permissions

To display information about a specific user, role or permission, or to
list all defined users, roles and permissions, use the <*auth show*>
command. For example, to show the <*admin*> user:

    osp> auth show user admin
----


!! Using LDAP for User Authentication and Authorization

Optionally, <[AuthAdminService]> can use LDAP for user authentication
and authorization. LDAP can be used for authentication (validating
passwords) only, or for both authentication and authorization (obtaining
a list of permissions and role assignments for an user).

To enable LDAP authentication, the following configuration settings must
be added to the global application configuration file:

  * auth.ldap.uri
  * auth.ldap.bindDN

To enable LDAP authorization, additionally the following configuration
settings must be added to the global application configuration file:

  * auth.ldap.permissionAttribute
  * auth.ldap.roleAttribute (optional)

Specifically, for LDAP authorization, the LDAP server must provide the
attribute specified in the <*auth.ldap.permissionAttribute*> configuration
setting. This attribute is used to store the permissions for a user.
Furthermore, in order to provide role assignments as well, the LDAP
server must provide the attribute specified in the
<*auth.ldap.roleAttribute*> configuration setting.

If the LDAP server provides permissions and roles, these always replace
the permissions and roles stored for that user in the database.
Permissions and roles are obtained from the LDAP server immediately
after the user account has been successfully validated by performing an
LDAP bind operation with the user’s credentials.

Permission assignments to roles are always stored in the <[AuthAdminService]> database.

If the LDAP server is unavailable, the <[AuthAdminService]> falls back to the
configured database.
