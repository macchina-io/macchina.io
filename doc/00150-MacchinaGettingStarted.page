Getting Started with macchina.io
AAAAMacchinaIO

!!!System Requirements

macchina.io can be installed on Linux and macOS systems.
On Linux, cross-compilation for embedded Linux targets is supported.

For the first steps, it is recommended to build and install macchina.io
on a desktop Linux or macOS system. This will get you up and running within
a few minutes. You can also build macchina.io on systems like a Raspberry Pi
or a Tinkerforge RED brick, but this will take a couple of hours.
Alternatively, you can cross-compile macchina.io for an embedded Linux target,
however, this will require a couple of extra steps in order to get everything
working.


!!!Getting macchina.io

macchina.io can be obtained from GitHub, by cloning the macchina.io repository.
Alternatively, you can also download a release archive in .zip or .tar.gz format
from the macchina.io [[https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io/releases GitHub Releases]]
page.

To clone the [[https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io macchina.io GitHub]] repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io.git
----

For the latest stable release, you may want to check out the master branch:

    $ cd macchina.io
    $ git checkout master
----

The default branch is the develop branch.


!!!Building macchina.io

!!Prerequisites

macchina.io uses the build system from the POCO C++ Libraries, which is based on
GNU Make. You'll also need a recent version of the GNU C++ compiler (at least
4.4) or Clang. Make sure you have the OpenSSL headers and libraries
installed, e.g.:

  - on Ubuntu: <[sudo apt-get install libssl-dev]>
  - on macOS: via [[http://brew.sh Homebrew]]: <[brew install openssl]>

Furthermore, Python is required for building the V8 JavaScript engine.


!!Compiling macchina.io

To build macchina.io, simply invoke GNU Make in the top-level macchina.io source
directory. On a multicore system with sufficient memory, you may want to run a
parallel build, by specifying the <*-j*> option.

    $ make -s -j8
----

This command will actually build both debug and release build configurations. To speed
things up, you may want to build the release configuration only:

    $ make -s -j8 DEFAULT_TARGET=shared_release
----

On a typical desktop or notebook machine, building macchina.io takes about 10 to 15 minutes.
If you're building on a system like a Raspberry Pi or Tinkerforge RED Brick, building
macchina.io will take a couple of hours. Don't attempt a parallel build (<*-j8*>) on these
systems. Furthermore, you may run out of memory during the build, especially while
building the V8 library. Try to restart the build and make sure as much memory as
possible is available, by stopping all unnecessary processes.
It may be better to cross-compile on a desktop system and transfer the
binaries to the target system.


!!Cross Compiling macchina.io

Note: if you want to run macchina.io on your desktop system only, you can safely
skip this section and continue with [[#6 Running macchina.io]].

macchina.io can be cross-compiled for an embedded Linux target. To cross-compile for
a target, a build configuration for the target must be created, or an existing build
configuration selected. A couple of configurations
for various Embedded Linux targets can be found in the <*platform/build/config*> directory.
A build configuration specifies the toolchain/compiler to be used as well as any special compiler
or linker arguments required for the target. It's best to create a new configuration
by copying an existing one and copying it into the <*platform/build/config*> directory.
Good starting points for ARM-based targets are <*DigiEL-A8*>, <*Angstrom*>, <*BeagleBoard*>,
<*Yocto*> or <*ELDK*>. If you have a basic understanding of cross-compiling for
embedded Linux systems, the build configuration files should be pretty self explaining.

You can find more information about build configurations and the build system in
general in then [[99150-GMakeBuildNotes.html POCO C++ Libraries GNU Make Build System]]
document.

Before cross-compiling for an embedded Linux target, you'll need to compile
the sources for a few libraries and tools for the host system. You can do that
with the following command:

   $ make -s -j8 hosttools
----

Note: You should not build the entire macchina.io for both host and target in the same directory
tree, except for the required host tools and libraries. After you've built macchina.io for the
target system, the bundle files will no longer be usable on the host as they contain the target
binaries only.

If you have found an existing, or created a new suitable build configuration for
your target, you can build for the target with the following command (assuming the
<*Yocto*> build configuration; replace this with your own):

    $ POCO_CONFIG=Yocto LINKMODE=SHARED make -s -j8 DEFAULT_TARGET=shared_release
----

Note: unless you intend to debug on the target, it is sufficient to build the
release configuration only.

After the build completes, you'll need to copy the following files to the target:

  - The following shared libraries (<*libPoco*.so.**>) from <*platform/lib/Linux/<target_arch>*>:
    Foundation, XML, JSON, Util, Net, Zip, Crypto, NetSSL, Geo, WebTunnel, RemotingNG and OSP.
  - All bundle files (<**.bndl*>) from <*platform/OSP/bundles*>, <*devices/bundles*>,
    <*protocols/bundles*>, <*services/bundles*>, <*webui/bundles*>, <*samples/bundles*>.
  - The macchina.io server executable: <*server/bin/Linux/<target_arch>/macchina*>.
  - The macchina.io server configuration file: <*server/macchina.properties*>.

The bundles should all be copied into a separate directory on the target. A recommended
filesystem layout on the target would be:

    <macchina_root>/
        lib/
            bundles/
        bin/
        etc/
----

All shared libraries should go into the <*lib*> directory, and all bundles go into the
<*lib/bundles*> directory.

You can use the <*install_runtime*> Makefile target to copy all these files into
a directory hierarchy like above:

    $ POCO_CONFIG=Yocto make -s install_runtime INSTALLDIR=/path/to/macchina-install-dir
----

Then you can simply pack the directory into an archive (e.g., <*.tar.gz*>) file and
transfer it to the target.

The configuration file for the macchina.io server, <*macchina.properties*> (located
in the <*server*> directory) should be copied into the <*etc*> directory on the target.
The configuration file needs to be modified for the target. Open the
<*macchina.properties*> in your favorite text editor and change the line

    osp.bundleRepository = ${application.configDir}../platform/OSP/bundles;...
----

to:

    osp.bundleRepository = /path/to/lib/bundles
----


!!!Running macchina.io

After the macchina.io build completes, you can directly run macchina.io without an
additional install step. To run the macchina.io server:

  1. Set your system's shared library search path to include the macchina.io libraries.
  2. Run the macchina.io server program.

To run macchina.io on a Linux system:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/macchina.io/platform/lib/Linux/x86_64
    $ cd /path/to/macchina.io/server
    $ bin/Linux/x86_64/macchina
----

To run macchina.io on an macOS system:

    $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/macchina.io/platform/lib/Darwin/x86_64
    $ cd /path/to/macchina.io/server
    $ bin/Darwin/x86_64/macchina
----

Note: if you macchina.io configuration file <*macchina.properties*> is not
located in the same directory as the server executable, or in a parent
directory of it, you'll need to specify the path to the configuration file
when starting the server:

    $ bin/Darwin/x86_64/macchina --config=/path/to/macchina.properties
----


After the macchina.io server has started, which may take a few seconds on slower systems,
direct your web browser of choice to http://localhost:22080. You'll see the
macchina.io login screen. User username "admin" and password "admin" to log
in. After successfully logging in you'll see the Launcher page of the web
interface. Try out the different web apps to familiarize yourself with the
web user interface.

The default configuration of macchina.io enables simulation of various
sensors, including a temperature and an ambient light sensor. You can
use these simulated sensors in the same way as you'd use any real
connected sensors in your code. The available sensors and their current
measurements can be seen on the "Sensors & Devices" app.

There's also the "Sensor Log" app which displays current and time series
sensor data from a configurable set of sensors.

To get the most out of macchina.io, you may want to get some real sensors.
In the developer preview release of macchina.io, only some Tinkerforge sensors
are supported. More sensors and devices will be supported in future releases.
You can of course also implement you own sensor types, once you're
familiar with the macchina.io Software Development Kit (SDK).


!!!Writing Your First JavaScript Program

In order to write your first JavaScript program that runs on macchina.io,
open the "Playground" app. The Playground allows you to create and edit
a JavaScript program directly in the browser, using a comfortable text
editor.

[[image:images/macchina_web_playground.png The macchina.io Playground, a JavaScript editor]]

Note that when working with the Playground app, it's a good idea to have a nearby
console window with macchina.io's log output open to see script output or error messages.
You can also open the "Console" app in a separate browser window.


!!Getting Sensor Data

The Playground comes pre-loaded with the macchina.io variant
of the "Hello, world!" program - a little program that finds a temperature
sensor and obtains the current temperature from the sensor. The program
is reproduced below for reference.

    //
    // Playground Sample Script
    //
    // This script will look for a temperature sensor and, if found,
    // output the current temperature.
    //
    // Feel free to modify this script as you like to try out
    // macchina.io features.
    //

    // Search for temperature sensors in the Service Registry
    var temperatureRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"');
    if (temperatureRefs.length > 0)
    {
        // Found at least one temperature sensor entry in the registry.
        // Resolve the first one.
        var temperatureSensor = temperatureRefs[0].instance();
        // Get current temperature.
        var temperature = temperatureSensor.value();
        logger.information('Current temperature: ' + temperature);
    }
    else
    {
        logger.error('No temperature sensor found.');
    }
----

The program shows two things:

  1. How to obtain a sensor service object from the Service Registry.
  2. How to write logging output.

To find available sensors in the system, you use the macchina.io Service Registry.
All sensors and devices supported by macchina.io will always be available as
service objects through that registry. In order to find a specific object, the
service registry supports a simple query expression language that allows you
to find services based on their properties.
In the example above, we specifically look for a temperature sensor. In macchina.io,
sensors always have a property named <*io.macchina.physicalQuantity*> that can be
used to search for sensors that measure a specific physical quantity.
The <*find*> method will return an array of service references. Service references
are different from actual service objects. Their purpose is to store service
properties (like the mentioned <*io.macchina.physicalQuantity*>), as well as
a reference to the actual service object. The actual service object can be
obtained by calling the instance() function, like we do in the sample.

Once we have the temperature sensor object, we can use it to obtain the current
value by calling the value() function.

In the Playground app, you can run the program by clicking the "Run" button
above the editor. Do it and observe the logging output of the macchina server.
It should contain something like:

    2015-03-07 13:12:31.630 [Information] osp.core.BundleLoader<2>: Bundle io.macchina.webui.playground.sandbox started
    2015-03-07 13:12:31.630 [Information] osp.bundle.com.appinf.osp.js<2>: Starting script sandbox.js from bundle io.macchina.webui.playground.sandbox.
    2015-03-07 13:12:31.631 [Information] osp.web.access<2>: POST /macchina/playground/run.json HTTP/1.1
    2015-03-07 13:12:31.688 [Information] osp.bundle.io.macchina.webui.playground.sandbox<28>: Current temperature: 26.999999999999975
----

In addition to querying the service registry directly for a specific kind of sensor or,
more generally, service, a program can also be notified if a service that matches a query
is registered with the service registry. This is done using a ServiceListener, and it's
specifically useful for services that may appear or disappear at any time.

The following short sample shows the usage of the ServiceListener.

    var listener = serviceRegistry.createListener(
        'io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"',
        (ref) => {
            console.log("Temperature sensor registered: %O", ref);
            var sensor = ref.instance();
            console.log("Current temperature: %f", sensor.value());
        },
        (ref) => {
            console.log("Temperature sensor unregistered: %O", ref);
        });
----

The <*createListener()*> method of the serviceRegistry object takes a query expression
(like <*find()*>) and two callback functions. The first one will called after a
matching service has been registered. The second one will be called after the
service has been unregistered.


!!Periodically Querying Sensor Data

As a next step, we're going to modify the program so that it will periodically output the
current temperature. We do this by setting up a timer. Here's the modified code:

    var temperatureRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"');
    if (temperatureRefs.length > 0)
    {
        var temperatureSensor = temperatureRefs[0].instance();
        logger.information('Found temperature sensor.');
        setInterval(
            () => {
                logger.information('Current temperature: ' + temperatureSensor.value());
            },
            1000
        );
    }
    else
    {
        logger.error('No temperature sensor found.');
    }
----

Replace the code in the editor with the above code and click the <*Restart*> button.
You'll see the temperature being printed once every second.


!!Handling Sensor Events

As the final step, we'll print the temperature only when it changes. For that purpose,
sensor objects provide an event that we can bind to a callback function. Whenever the
sensor value changes, our callback function will be called and the current temperature
will be written to the log.

    var temperatureRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"');
    if (temperatureRefs.length > 0)
    {
        var temperatureSensor = temperatureRefs[0].instance();
        temperatureSensor.on('valueChanged',
            (event) => {
                logger.information('Temperature changed: ' + event.data);
            }
        );
    }
    else
    {
        logger.error('No temperature sensor found.');
    }
----


!!Sending Sensor Data Using MQTT

Let's now extend the sample to send sensor data over the internet to a server,
using the MQTT protocol. We're going to use the MQTT sandbox server provided by
the Eclipse foundation, which is pre-configured in the macchina.io configuration
file. We'll return to the example using the timer and modify it to send the
current temperature every 10 seconds.

    var temperatureSensor;
    var temperatureRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"');
    if (temperatureRefs.length > 0)
    {
        logger.information('Temperature sensor found.');
        temperatureSensor = temperatureRefs[0].instance();
    }
    else
    {
        logger.error('No temperature sensor found.');
    }

    var mqttClientRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.mqtt.id == "eclipse"');
    if (mqttClientRefs.length > 0)
    {
        logger.information("MQTT Client found.");

        var mqttClient;
        mqttClient = mqttClientRefs[0].instance();

        setInterval(
            () => {
                var payload = JSON.stringify(temperatureSensor.value());
                logger.information('Sending temperature: ' + payload);
                // Send payload using QoS 0
                mqttClient.publish('macchina-io/samples/temperature', payload, 0);
            },
            10000
        );
    }
    else
    {
        logger.error('No MQTT Client found.');
    }
----

The MQTT client is another service that's available from the service registry.
We can discover it by looking for a <*io.macchina.mqtt.serverURI*> property.
Based on the value of this property, we could also look for a specific client,
e.g. "tcp://iot.eclipse.org:1883".


!!HTTP Web Services

As a final example in this tutorial, we'll show how to invoke a HTTP based web
service from JavaScript. If the temperature exceeds a certain limit, we'll
send a SMS message using [[http://www.twilio.com Twilio]]. Note that for this
example to work, you'll need to have a Twilio account with the ability to send SMS
messages.

    var net = require('net');

    function sendSMS(message)
    {
        var username = application.config.getString('twilio.username');
        var password = application.config.getString('twilio.password');
        var from = application.config.getString('twilio.from');
        var to = application.config.getString('twilio.to');

        var twilioHttpRequest = new net.HTTPRequest('POST', 'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/' + username + '/SMS/Messages');
        twilioHttpRequest.authenticate(username, password);
        twilioHttpRequest.contentType = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded';
        twilioHttpRequest.content =
            'From=' + encodeURIComponent(from) +
            '&To=' + encodeURIComponent(to) +
            '&Body=' + encodeURIComponent(message);

        var response = twilioHttpRequest.send((result) => {
            logger.information('SMS sent with HTTP status: ' + result.response.status);
            logger.information(result.response.content);
        });
    }

    var smsSent = false;

    var temperatureRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"');
    if (temperatureRefs.length > 0)
    {
        var temperatureSensor = temperatureRefs[0].instance();
        temperatureSensor.on('valueChanged',
            (event) => {
                logger.information('Temperature changed: ' + event.data);
                if (event.data > 30 && !smsSent)
                {
                	logger.warning('Temperature limit exceeded. Sending SMS.');
                    sendSMS('Temperature limit exceeded!');
                    smsSent = true;
                }
            }
        );
    }
    else
    {
        logger.error('No temperature sensor found.');
    }
----

All new code is in the sendSMS() function. We're using the <*application.config*>
object to access configuration settings from the <*macchina.properties*>
configuration file. For this example to work you'll need to add the following
lines to the configuration file:

    twilio.username = <your_twilio_account_sid>
    twilio.password = <your_twilio_auth_token>
    twilio.from = <your_twilio_outgoing_phone_number>
    twilio.to = <recipient_phone_number>
----

Of course you'll need to replace the placeholders (<*<your_twilio_account_sid>*>, etc.)
with the proper values from your Twilio account.
We're using the HTTPRequest class from the <*net*> module for sending the HTTPS POST
request to the Twilio API. The HTTPS request is sent asynchronously.
We'll notified of the result via the callback function we provide to the send() function.
