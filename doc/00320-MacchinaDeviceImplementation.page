!!!Introduction

Communicating with sensors and other devices is a core feature of macchina.io EDGE.
macchina.io EDGE comes with a set of pre-defined service interfaces for various
sensor and device types. This means that sensors of a certain type, like
temperature sensors or accelerometers, always have the same programming
interface, no matter how they are actually implemented.

The pre-defined sensor and device interfaces in macchina.io EDGE are:

  - Accelerometer (IoT::Devices::Accelerometer)
  - BarcodeReader (IoT::Devices::BarcodeReader)
  - BooleanSensor (IoT::Devices::BooleanSensor)
  - Camera (IoT::Devices::Camera)
  - Counter (IoT::Devices::Counter)
  - GNSSSensor (IoT::Devices::GNSSSensor)
  - Gyroscope (IoT::Devices::Gyroscope)
  - IO/GPIO (IoT::Devices::IO)
  - LED (IoT::Devices::LED)
  - Magnetometer (IoT::Devices::Magnetometer)
  - RotaryEncoder (IoT::Devices::RotaryEncoder)
  - Sensor (IoT::Devices::Sensor)
  - SerialDevice (IoT::Devices::SerialDevice)
  - Switch (IoT::Devices::Switch)
  - Trigger (IoT::Devices::Trigger)

Every sensor or device in macchina.io EDGE is an OSP service implementing
one of these C++ interfaces.

Simple sensors, like temperature or humidity sensors that only provide a single value,
are based on the IoT::Devices::Sensor interface. There are also more specific interfaces
for sensors like accelerometers, GPIOs or GPS/GNSS receivers.


!!!Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes the you've already obtained the macchina.io EDGE sources from
its Git repository and built macchina.io EDGE for your host system, according to the
instructions in the [[00150-MacchinaGettingStarted.html Getting Started]] document.
You should also have worked through the
[[00210-MacchinaCppProgramming.html macchina.io EDGE C++ Programming Guide]] and be
familiar with the basics of C++ programming with the macchina.io EDGE framework.
You should also have a good understanding of OSP bundles and services.


!!!Writing Your First Sensor Implementation in C++

As a first example, we will write a Sensor service that provides an interface
to the Linux thermal subsystem. Modern CPUs and SoCs have on-chip temperature
sensors, and the Linux thermal subsystem provides a standard interface for
reading them. For example, on a Raspberry Pi, the SoC temperature can be obtained
by reading the file <*/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp*>:

   pi@raspberrypi:~$ cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
   42932
----

The obtained value (42932) needs to be divided by 1000 to obtain the temperature in degrees
Celsius (42.932 °C).

To make this value available in macchina.io EDGE through a Sensor service, the following
steps must be taken:

  1. A new project for a sensor bundle must be set up.
  2. A subclass of the IoT::Devices::Sensor class must be
     created.
  3. A BundleActivator class must be implemented, which must
     create an instance (or multiple instances) of the sensor
     class and register it with the OSP service registry.


!!Setting Up a Device or Sensor Bundle C++ Project

In the first step, we will create a sensor with only the most basic
features. The project is called <*LinuxThermalSimple*>.

The basic directory structure for the sensor device project looks as follows:

  LinuxThermalSimple/
      Makefile
      LinuxThermalSimple.bndlspec
      src/
          LinuxThermalSensor.h
          LinuxThermalSensor.cpp
          BundleActivator.cpp
----

The project directory contains a <[Makefile]> and a bundle specification file, as well
as the header and implementation file for the <[LinuxThermalSensor]> class and the
implementation file for the <[BundleActivator]>.

!!The Sensor Class

Let's have a look a the <[LinuxThermalSensor]> class first.

Every sensor or device implementation must implement the basic
IoT::Devices::Device interface. This interface defines a number of methods
that every device or sensor must provide. Specifically, these are methods
for inquiring and changing device properties and features. Properties and
features are used as a generic extension mechanism, allowing each device
to expose properties or features not available in the generic interface.

Properties can be used to configure devices, or to obtain additional data
a sensor provides in addition to the actual value. Features are used to
enable or disable device-specific features.

As a look at the IoT::Devices::Device interface reveals, there is quite a
number of methods that must be implemented to satisfy the interface.
The main reason for this is that properties can have different types,
and there are setter and getter methods for each property type. The
Remoting framework, which is used to implement the JavaScript bridging
unfortunately does not support any-style types like Poco::Any or
Poco::DynamicAny, so separate methods have to be used for the supported
property types <[std::string]>, <[int]>, <[double]> and <[bool]>.

!The DeviceImpl Class Template

Since implementing all these methods for every device class would be very
tedious, help in the form of the IoT::Devices::DeviceImpl class template
is available. This template implements all required methods in a generic
way and allows derived classes to register specific getter and setter
member functions for the properties and features they support.

The IoT::Devices::DeviceImpl takes two template parameters. The first one
is the interface class of the actual device or sensor type to be implemented
(e.g., IoT::Devices::Sensor, or IoT::Devices::Accelerometer). The second
parameter is the class you are implementing, which is derived from
IoT::Devices::DeviceImpl. This "famous" C++ idiom is called the
[[Curiously Recurring Template Pattern https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern]]
(or <*CRTP*> for short).

So let's have a look at the <[LinuxThermalSensor]> class definition:

    class LinuxThermalSensor: public IoT::Devices::DeviceImpl<IoT::Devices::Sensor, LinuxThermalSensor>
    {
    public:
        LinuxThermalSensor(const std::string& devicePath);

        ~LinuxThermalSensor() = default;

        // Sensor
        double value() const;
        bool ready() const;

        static const std::string NAME;
        static const std::string TYPE;
        static const std::string SYMBOLIC_NAME;
        static const std::string PHYSICAL_QUANTITY;

    protected:
        Poco::Any getDisplayValue(const std::string&) const;
        Poco::Any getName(const std::string&) const;
        Poco::Any getType(const std::string&) const;
        Poco::Any getSymbolicName(const std::string&) const;
        Poco::Any getPhysicalQuantity(const std::string&) const;
        Poco::Any getPhysicalUnit(const std::string&) const;

    private:
        std::string _path;
    };
----

Note: the [[https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io/tree/develop/samples/LinuxThermalSimple full source code]]
can be found in the macchina.io EDGE <*samples*> folder.

First thing we notice is the mentioned CRTP idiom when using the IoT::Devices::DeviceImpl
class template as base class for our <[LinuxThermalSensor]>. Therefore, the first
template argument is IoT::Devices::Sensor, which is the actual interface the
<[LinuxThermalSensor]> class implements. The second template argument is the
<[LinuxThermalSensor]> class itself.

The rest of the <[LinuxThermalSensor]> is not too complicated. The IoT::Devices::Sensor
interface defines two methods that must be implemented - <[value()]> which returns the
current sensor value, and <[ready()]> which returns <[true]> if the sensor device is
ready to report a value, or otherwise <[false]>.

!Device Properties

The IoT::Devices::Sensor interface also requires a few read-only properties providing
meta-data about the sensor to be implemented, as well as the "displayValue" property
which is used to display the sensor value in the macchina.io EDGE web user interface and
other places.

The following read-only properties (all of type <[std::string]>) must be implemented:

  - symbolicName: A unique name in reverse DNS notation (like a bundle symbolic name)
    which identifies the device class. For this example, the symbolic name is
    "io.macchina.linux-thermal-simple".
  - name: A user-readable name for the device ("Linux Thermal Sensor").
  - type: The symbolic name of the device interface used. For IoT::Devices::Sensor
    it is "io.macchina.sensor". See the IoT::Devices::Device class for a list of
    types.
  - physicalQuantity: The physical quantity that is being measured by the sensor, e.g.
    "temperature".
  - physicalUnit: The physical unit the measured value
    is being represented in (e.g. "Cel" for degree Celsius).
    This should use the "c/s" symbols from the Unified Code for Units of Measure
    (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html).
    See the PHYSICAL_UNIT_* string constants in the The IoT::Devices::Sensor for predefined values.
  - displayValue: The current value of the sensor, formatted as string for display purposes
    (e.g. in the web user interface). This property is optional, but it's good practice
    to implement it for every sensor.

!!Implementing the Sensor Class

!The Constructor

In the implementation of the <[LinuxThermalSensor]>, there are two methods of interest.
The first one is the constructor:

    LinuxThermalSensor::LinuxThermalSensor(const std::string& path):
        _path(path + "/temp")
    {
        addProperty("displayValue", &LinuxThermalSensor::getDisplayValue);
        addProperty("symbolicName", &LinuxThermalSensor::getSymbolicName);
        addProperty("name", &LinuxThermalSensor::getName);
        addProperty("type", &LinuxThermalSensor::getType);
        addProperty("physicalQuantity", &LinuxThermalSensor::getPhysicalQuantity);
        addProperty("physicalUnit", &LinuxThermalSensor::getPhysicalUnit);
    }
----

The constructor takes the path to the Linux thermal device as argument
(e.g. "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0"), adds the "/temp" part for the
file to read the actual value from, and stores it in the <[_path]> member
variable.

Then it registers the getter methods for the supported properties, by calling
the <[addProperty()]> method inherited from the <[DeviceImpl]> base class.

!The value() Method

The implementation of the <[value()]> method is quite trivial in this case.
It simply reads the contents of the "temp" file from the Linux thermal
subsystem and divides the value by 1000 to get the correctly scaled value.

    double LinuxThermalSensor::value() const
    {
        Poco::FileInputStream istr(_path);
        int value;
        istr >> value;
        return value/1000.0;
    }
----

!The ready() Method

For implementing this sample class, we assume that the sensor is always ready.
Therefore, the <[ready()]> class simply returns <[true]>.

!The getDisplayValue() Method

This method simply formats the double value as a string, using the
Poco::NumberFormatter::format() method.

!Meta-Information Property Getters

The property getters for meta-information (symbolicName, name, type, etc.)
simply return a string constant with the appropriate value.

!!Implementing the BundleActivator

The BundleActivator implementation creates and registers an instance of the
<[LinuxThermalSensor]> service. To make the sensor also usable from
JavaScript code, the Remoting framework is used. The <[LinuxThermalSensor]>
instance is not directly registered as an OSP service class. This would not
be possible anyway, because <[LinuxThermalSensor]> is not implementing
the Poco::OSP::Service interface. Instead, the Remoting framework is used
to create a IoT::Devices::SensorRemoteObject wrapping the <[LinuxThermalSensor]>
object. The IoT::Devices::SensorRemoteObject is then registered with the
service registry.

In order to make the <[LinuxThermalSensor]> discoverable through the
service registry, three service properties are provided for registration.
All sensor and device implementations should provide these service properties when
registering the service.

For example, by registering the "io.macchina.physicalQuantity" property, code
looking for a temperature sensor can look for temperature sensors
the following way (in JavaScript):

    var temperatureRefs = serviceRegistry.find('io.macchina.physicalQuantity == "temperature"');
----

All this is implemented in the <[createSensor()]> method in our <[BundleActivator]> class:

    Poco::OSP::ServiceRef::Ptr createSensor(const std::string& id, const std::string& path)
    {
        // Define an alias to the ServerHelper class for convenience.
        using ServerHelper = typedef Poco::RemotingNG::ServerHelper<IoT::Devices::Sensor>;

        // Create the LinuxThermalSensor instance...
        Poco::SharedPtr<LinuxThermalSensor> pSensor = new LinuxThermalSensor(path);

        // and wrap it in a RemoteObject.
        ServerHelper::RemoteObjectPtr pSensorRemoteObject = ServerHelper::createRemoteObject(pSensor, id);

        // Set the service properties.
        Properties props;
        props.set("io.macchina.device", LinuxThermalSensor::SYMBOLIC_NAME);
        props.set("io.macchina.deviceType", LinuxThermalSensor::TYPE);
        props.set("io.macchina.physicalQuantity", LinuxThermalSensor::PHYSICAL_QUANTITY);

        // Register the RemoteObject as a service and return its ServiceRef::Ptr.
        return _pContext->registry().registerService(id, pSensorRemoteObject, props);
    }
----

The <[start()]> method of the <[BundleActivator]> reads the path of the device
directory in <*/sys/class*> from the configuration (using the Poco::OSP::PreferencesService),
then checks whether the device directory exists. If so, it calls <[createSensor()]> to
create and register the service for the <[LinuxThermalSensor]>.

    void start(BundleContext::Ptr pContext)
    {
        _pContext = pContext;

        Poco::OSP::PreferencesService::Ptr pPrefs = ServiceFinder::find<PreferencesService>(pContext);

        std::string path = pPrefs->configuration()->getString("linux-thermal-simple.path", "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0");
        Poco::File file(path);
        if (file.exists())
        {
            _pServiceRef = createSensor(LinuxThermalSensor::SYMBOLIC_NAME, path);
        }
        else
        {
            pContext->logger().warning("Thermal device file not found: %s", path);
        }
    }
----

The <[stop()]> method unregisters the service and resets all smart pointers.

    void stop(BundleContext::Ptr pContext)
    {
        pContext->registry().unregisterService(_pServiceRef);
        _pServiceRef.reset();
        _pContext.reset();
    }
----
